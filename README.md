**Songify** is a robust REST API engineered as a **Modular Monolith** using **Java 21**. It utilizes **Virtual Threads** to handle high-throughput operations efficiently while enforcing strict domain isolation. The application is secured via **Spring Security** and **OAuth2**, backed by **Hibernate** and a **Dockerized PostgreSQL** instance.

#### Key Highlights

* **Architecture:** Designed as a **Modular Monolith** to combine the deployment simplicity of a monolith with the maintainability of microservices (future-proofed for splitting).
* **Docs:** Fully documented via **Swagger**, alongside detailed technical, user, and security requirement specifications.
* **Quality Assurance:** Validated through rigorous **Unit** and **Integration testing**.
