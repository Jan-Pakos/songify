Songify is a robust REST API engineered as a Modular Monolith using Java 21. It utilizes Virtual Threads to handle high-throughput operations efficiently while enforcing strict domain isolation. The application is secured via Spring Security and OAuth2, backed by Hibernate and a Dockerized PostgreSQL instance.

Key Highlights:

Architecture: Modular Monolith to combine the simplicity of deployment with the maintainability of microservices, and the possibility to split it up into microservices later.

Docs: Swagger, alongside detailed technical, user, and security requirement specifications.

Quality Assurance: Unit and Integration testing.
