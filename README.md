## Songify

A robust REST API engineered as a **Modular Monolith** using **Java 21**. It utilizes **Virtual Threads** to handle high-throughput operations efficiently while enforcing strict domain isolation. The application is secured via **Spring Security** and **OAuth2**, backed by **Hibernate** and a **Dockerized PostgreSQL** instance. **The entire testing and build lifecycle is automated using GitHub Actions.**
